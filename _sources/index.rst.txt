Introduction
------------

``pubtools`` comprises a family of Python libraries implementing content
publishing workflows.

``pubtools`` can be read two ways. Firstly, it is short for "publishing tools",
which describes the scope of these projects. Secondly, it can be read as
"tools for Pub", because these tools are most commonly hosted within a
service known as "Pub".
